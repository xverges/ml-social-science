== Agenda

. How do _<insert noun>_ learn?
. AI, ML, NLP, DL... Hints to navigate the alphabet soup
. Five main routes to Machine Learning
. Data is the new...
. Machine Learning and Social Science: Two Cultures
. Activity: read and tell


== Objectives

I want the audience to

* Become familiar with some Machine Learning concepts
* Understand some of the risks of using data
* Become familiar with the differences of the main world views of Machine Learning and Econometrics
* Consider adding a new feedback loop to their life


== In Praise of Feedback Loops

Outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a loop. *The system can then be said to feed back into itself*.

== The 5 Tribes of ML

From *Pedro Domingo*'s  _The Master Algorithm_:

[%step]
* The Symbolists
** Work with high-level, human-readable, representations of problems, logic and search
** Expert Systems
* The Connectionists
** Focus on re-engineering the brain
** Artificial Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
* The Evolutionaries
** Genetic Algorithms
* The Bayesians
** Probability-based hypothesis that are updated as more data is processed
** Spam filters
* The Analogizers 
** Focus on techniques to match pieces of data to each other

[canvas-image=./images/scikit-learn-cheat-sheet.png]
== Algorithms, and algorithms, and algorithms...

Machine Learning and +
Social Science Statistics

== Understand or Predict?

* *Traditional Econometric Models* 
** Seek to give understanding
** Based on assumptions and probabilities
** Hand-crafted feature selection
** Mostly linear
** *data + simple models + advanced math*

* *Machine Learning Models*
** Seek to give predictive accuracy
** Fewer assumptions
** Automatic feature selection
** Non-linear
** **lots of data + complex models + optimizer**

== Overfitting

image::./images/overfitting1.png[]
image::./images/overfitting2.png[]


== Causality and Predictions

* Examples
** Hotel prices: predicting occupancy vs estimating the effect of raising pricesl
** Crime rates in a zone and number of policeman there
* Determining causation requires understanding
* Accurate predictions can help experimentation as a (sort-of) control group
